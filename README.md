# http-botbase

## A project heavily based on sys-botbase that allows remote control via HTTP

Wireless communication [is notoriously unreliable](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4361162_Wireless_reliability_Rethinking_80211_packet_loss), and this sysmodule attempts to offer a better solution, solely based on wireless communication, to avoid packet loss using a well-established - albeit admittedly much slower - packet loss tolerant protocol: HTTP.

This project is currently under active development, expect bugs and crashes.
